Yes, itʼs true.The jaguar has been far less frequently featured as a performer, compared to the other Big Cats. This has mostly to do with their personality. A jaguarʼs personality is different from the others. It differs in many ways, all of which contribute to its refusal to be “tamed”.</p>

          <p class="lead text-center text-sm-center text-faded">Jaguars kill       differently. Nearly all mammal predators kill in the same
              way. They go for the neck, either in back or the throat in front.
              Jaguars attack the head. They have been often known to rip the
              cranial cap right off their prey. They have the strongest jaw strength
              of all the cats, by far. Twice that of a lion. They can open their jaws
              further than any other cat. They sink their teeth into the skull. This
              indicates less intimidation. They donʼt worry about getting right in
              the face of their victims, literally. This lack of intimidation plays a
              part in the elevated danger of trying to interact with a jaguar you
              are trying to tame.</p>

                                  They are the most unpredictable of all the    cats. You simply canʼt
                                  get into the head of a jaguar. They are less emotive. Have fewer
                                  signals of what they may do. Without notice, they will lunge for you
                                  even through a fence.

                                 They are the moodiest of the cats. In captivity, they most often
                                 brood, rather than be openly aggressive. They donʼt react to stimuli
                                 in the same way that the other cats do. This is another aspect of
                                 their unpredictability.

                                the special pains, different methods, and extra level of bravery (i.e.
                                cojones) needed to train jaguars. The lion, tiger and leopard live in
                                areas where the capture and training of these animals has gone on
                                for centuries. Therefore there is more knowledge in their taking and
                                their handling.

                                Jaguars were either feared and killed or feared and worshiped. They just donʼt
                                “break”. They arenʼt necessarily the most dangerous of the cats, for the
                                simple reason that they will avoid you at all costs; more so than the
                                other cats; with the caveat that you leave them alone. If you break that
                                unspoken contract, they will break you before you break them.
